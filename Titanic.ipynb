    "\n",
    "The RMS Titanic was a passenger liner built in 1912 and at the time had the distinction of being the largest sea-going vessel in the world. However, its legacy was forever defined the morning of April 15, 1912 when on its maiden voyage. While navigating the icy and treacherous North Atlantic waters off the coast of Newfoundland, the ship collided with an iceberg in the early morning hours. The collision compromised the integrity of the vessel's hull leading it to take on large amounts of water. Gorged with water and straining to stay afloat, the mighty vessel upended, heaving its stern high into the air. Not intended to handle the stresses of such a posture, the boat broke in two and sank to its current resting place on the ocean floor just hours after the fateful collision.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were over 2,200 people on board for the trek (885 crew and 1317 passengers), yet the Titanic was only equipped with enough lifeboats to accommodate 1178 people. Sadly, even less people were saved since many life-boats were launched at less than peak capacity during the evacuation. Tragically, more than 1,500 people drowned or froze to death that day in the icy waters of the North Atlantic making the Titanic's sinking one of history's most infamous maritime disasters. The dataset you will be analyzing is a listing of the passenger log and contains the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Name: The name of the passenger\n",
    "\n",
    "*Age: The passenger's age at the time of the sinking. With the exception of infants under 1 year old, the age is rounded to the nearest integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pclass: The class of accommodation the passenger was travelling in. 1st class accommodations were the most expensive and offered passengers the most luxurious accommodations for the trans- oceanic trip. While still having many comforts, 2nd class was not as lavish as 1st class but also more affordable whereas 3rd class was the cheapest and only provided the most basic of accommodations. Given the disparity between the costs of the accommodations, only the opulent and privileged could enjoy the luxuries afforded by first class leaving second class to be filled by those whose level of wealth was not as exorbitant as those in 1st class. However, for those with little, 3rd class was the only accommodations affordable. Consequently, the class of accommodations is often used as a proxy for a passenger's socio-economic standing within society at that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Sex: The gender of the passenger.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Survived: A 0-1 coded variable where 1 indicates the passenger survived and 0 indicates they perished.\n"

    "Question: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. focus on the passenger class. For each class, calculate and report the proportion of passengers who survived. Are there differences between the proportions of people who survived in each class? Is there any trend?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Since there were not enough life-boats to accommodate every passenger, when it came time to evacuate the ship the time-honored tradition of \"women and children first\" was practiced when determining who would be granted a spot on a life boat. Similar to part 1, calculate and report the proportion of women who survived and the proportion of men who survived and comment on your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For age, create the following age groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Children: Less than 17 years old\n",
    "*   Young Adults: 18 years old to 30 years old\n",
    "*   Middle Aged: 31 to 50 years old\n",
    "*   Elderly: Greater than 50 years old\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate and report the proportion of people who survived for each age group separately. Are there any differences/trends for the proportions of survivors in each age group?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Fit a logistic regression model where the response variable is survival and the explanatory variables are age (as a numerical variable) and passenger class & gender as categorical variables. For incorporating the categorical variables, use a fixed slope model for each one (do no not use any interaction terms).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Report the estimated coefficients and interpret them.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. It is desired to know whether there was preferential treatment for those of higher socio- economic standing when deciding who will be able to board a life-boat and thus survive. Based on your findings from part 1. Set up and execute the proper hypothesis tests to determine whether any preferential treatment was present. Recall there were three passenger classes, so one must do a separate test comparing each class pairwise. Perform the tests so that the overall Type I error is no greater than alpha = 0.1."

The proportions_ztest() function takes two arrays as inputs: the number of successes (survivors) and the total number of trials (passengers) for each sample being compared.
